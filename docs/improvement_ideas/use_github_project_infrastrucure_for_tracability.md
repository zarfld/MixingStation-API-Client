Using GitHub Issues, especially when coupled with GitHub Projects, allows you to establish crucial traceability links required throughout the life cycle:
| Item to Trace | Linked GitHub Issue Artifact | Standard Traceability Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stakeholder Requirement/Feature (StR)** | Parent Issue (Epic), Issue Description | Defines the source/need. |
| **Requirement/Task** | Sub-issues, Linked Issues | Documents the allocation and flow-down. |
| **Implementation/Code** | Linked Pull Request (PR), Branch, Commits | Links the requirement to the code realization. |
| **Test/Verification** | Acceptance Criteria in Issue, Linked Test Artifacts | Verifies fulfillment and detects regressions. |
This approach provides **bidirectional traceability** between requirements, architectural entities, interface definitions, analysis results, and verification methods. Bidirectional traceability improves the integrity and accuracy of all requirements, allows tracking development and allocation, and supports easier maintenance and change implementation.
